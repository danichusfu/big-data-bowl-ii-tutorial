```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(snakecase)
```

Some code from last week. Make sure you have a folder called data that has the data called `train.csv`.

```{r}
data <- 
  read_csv("data/train.csv", col_types = list(WindSpeed = col_character()))

data <-
  data %>%
  rename_all(to_snake_case)
```


# select function

the `select` function allows us to "select" columns. 


So here is our data 

```{r}
data
```

Now if we only want the columns witht the x and y location of the player and game play and player identifiers.

```{r}
data %>%
  select(x, y, play_id, game_id, nfl_id)
```

Now with that example select all the columns that are player specific.

```{r}

```


# filter function


# mutate function

# group by / summarise functions
